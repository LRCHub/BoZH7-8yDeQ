[00:20.36] Still don't know what I was waiting for
[00:24.60] And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets and
[00:29.09] Every time I thought I'd got it made
[00:33.25] It seemed the taste was not so sweet
[00:51.25] 
[00:37.48] So I turned myself to face me
[00:42.19] But I've never caught a glimpse
[00:46.25] Of how the others must see the faker
[00:49.84] I'm much too fast to take that test
[01:07.34] 
[00:53.14] Ch-ch-changes
[00:55.34] (Turn and face the strain)
[00:57.54] Ch-ch-changes
[00:59.68] (Don't want to be a richer man)
[01:15.18] 
[01:03.14] Ch-ch-changes
[01:04.71] (Turn and face the strain)
[01:06.87] Ch-ch-changes
[01:08.92] (Just gonna have to be a different man)
[01:28.42] 
[01:11.82] Time may change me
[01:15.14] But I can't trace time
[01:26.14] 
[01:29.46] I watch the ripples change their size
[01:33.77] But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
[01:38.29] So the days float through my eyes
[01:42.48] But still the days seem the same
[01:58.48] 
[01:45.02] And these children that you spit on
[01:50.52] As they try to change their worlds
[01:54.78] Are immune to your consultations
[01:59.18] They're quite aware of what they're going through
[02:23.68] 
[02:02.00] Ch-ch-changes
[02:03.40] (Turn and face the strain)
[02:05.96] Ch-ch-changes
[02:07.93] (Don't tell them to grow up and out of it)
[02:28.93] 
[02:10.96] Ch-ch-changes
[02:13.13] (Turn and face the strain)
[02:15.55] Ch-ch-changes
[02:17.55] (Where's your shame, you've left us up to our necks in it)
[02:46.55] 
[02:20.68] Time may change me
[02:23.17] But you can't trace time
[02:35.17] 
[02:26.86] Strange fascination, fascinating me
[02:35.37] Ah changes are taking the pace I'm going through
[02:59.37] 
[02:42.67] Ch-ch-changes
[02:43.92] (Turn and face the strain)
[02:46.51] Ch-ch-changes
[02:48.55] (Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers)
[03:05.55] 
[02:51.24] Ch-ch-changes
[02:53.38] (Turn and face the strain)
[02:55.65] Ch-ch-changes
[02:57.89] (Pretty soon now you're gonna get older)
[03:17.89] 
[03:00.32] Time may change me
[03:03.78] But I can't trace time
[03:06.73] I said that time may change me
[03:10.08] But I can't trace time
