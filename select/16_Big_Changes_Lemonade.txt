Can you feel, the ice is shifting
I used to do all the listening
You and I are switching places
Trading loves and changing faces

You stepped inside me for a minute
Looked at this place through my vision
You and I are switching places
Trading lives and changing faces

Covered a lot of your heart, girl
But there's a bit that's showing

Cause we're changing places
And you're missing me now
Cause we're changing places

How does it seem now?
How do you feel now?
